# Quiet

### A MacOS menu bar app that plays the sounds that help you get stuff done in one click.

Need 2 minutes to focus on that code review? Press play and drown the world out a little.

- Quiet loops a white noise track by default
- Drag and drop your favourite beat to loop that instead
- Once installed Quiet launches on startup
- Double click to quit
- Automatic updates
